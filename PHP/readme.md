# Fibbonaci

The fibonnaci sequence takes the sum of the two previous positive integers to generate the next one. It has two base cases: 0, and 1 (neither of which have 2 previous positive integers).
Every other integer has a fibbonaci value, as demonstrated in this table:

| 0     | 0                           |
| 1     | 1                           |
| 2     | 1                           |
| 3     | 2                           |
| 4     | 3                           |
| 5     | 5                           |
| 6     | 8                           |
| 7     | 13                          |
| 8     | 21                          |
| 9     | 34                          |
| 10    | 55                          |
| 11    | 89                          |
| 12    | 144                         |
| 13    | 233                         |
| 14    | 377                         |
| 15    | 610                         |
